## Simon-Game
This game has four buttons named red, blue, green and yellow. 
The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
 If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and levels increases.
 Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
